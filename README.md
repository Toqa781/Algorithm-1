# **Algorithm-1

## **Overview**
This repository contains **C++ implementations** of various fundamental algorithms and data structures. These implementaion covers Fibonacci series, search algorithms, and heap-based operations.

## **Contents**

### **Fibonacci Series**
Implementation of the Fibonacci series using three different methods:
1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Computes the nth Fibonacci number using a straightforward recursive function.
2. **Divide and Conquer (Matrix Multiplication)**:
   - Utilizes matrix exponentiation for efficient computation of the nth Fibonacci number.
3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Computes the Fibonacci series using a bottom-up approach for optimal performance.

### **Search Algorithms**
Implementation of sequential and binary search algorithms in both iterative and recursive forms:
1. **Sequential Search**:
   - **Iterative Implementation**:
     - Define a function that searches for a target value in an unsorted list.
     - If the target value is found, return the index; otherwise, return an indication that it is not found.
   - **Recursive Implementation**:
     - Define a recursive function to search for the target value.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - **Iterative Implementation**:
     - Define a function to search for a target value in a sorted list.
   - **Recursive Implementation**:
     - Define a recursive function that takes a list, a target value, low, and high indices as inputs.


### **Heap, Priority Queue, and Heap Sort**
1. **Heap Implementation**:
   - Custom heap class with methods for:
     - Inserting elements while maintaining the heap property.
     - Extracting the minimum/maximum element.
2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Built using the heap implementation, with methods for:
     - Inserting elements with priorities.
     - Extracting the highest-priority element.
3. **Heap Sort**:
   - Sorts an array by:
     - Building a max heap from the array.
     - Repeatedly extracting the maximum element to sort the array.
